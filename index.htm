Hi!<br>
  It's nice to see you in here! You may have expected some great stuff on here... but it's actually nothing!

  
I don't have much of time to update or manage this website since I've other projects and sites, but you must've asked yourself WHY? Why did you spend money to make a website you don't have time to manage?

  
Well, The answer is simple.<br>
  <font size="35"><B>BECAUSE I CAN, AND I JUST DID!</B></font>
  
  AH! sorry if that was lame, but the real reason why is becuase this website is just a front for other shady sites and projects underneath this squeaky-clean page!
  <br> Keep this a secret between us. (cheesy, right?)
  
  
  I hope to see you again.
  
  <I>-- Anas.</I>
